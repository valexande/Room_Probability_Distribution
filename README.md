# Room_Probability_Distribution
Given a object that is part of the English Language the algorithm returns a probability distribution over a set of room for where the item is usually located.

by Alexandros Vassiliades, Nick Bassiliades

We have created an algorithm that based on a probability distribution it returns the probability of: "In which room is most likely located the object X". For the probability distribution we use information from ConceptNet, DBpedia, Our own IKEA dataset, VirtualHome Dataset, and AI2THOR.
